# DINO-with-ConViT-backbone
Pytorch code for DINO with ConViT Backbone( Improving Vision Transformers with Soft Convolutional Inductive Biases) ICML2021

This is the codee for the implementation of DINO(Emerging properties of self supervised vision transformers) with ConviT Backbone. Since the original vision transformers 
(ViT) are data hungry and require massive amounts of training data, we had an idea to use one of the recent and more data efficient types of vision transformers to make 
the training of DINO possible on smaller datasets such as the CIFAR10 dataset.
